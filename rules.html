          <h2>Ultimate Frisbee</h2>
          <p>Ultimate is a non-contact, self-officiated team sport played with a flying disc. Two teams of seven compete on a field similar in length to a football field but narrower, with end zones at each end. Teams score by catching the disc in the opponentâ€™s end zone. The player with the disc (the thrower) cannot run and must pass it in any direction. If the disc is dropped or intercepted, possession changes. The defending team becomes the offense and attempts to score in the opposite end zone.</p>

          <p>Ultimate is a non-contact, self-officiated team sport played with a flying disc. Two teams of seven compete to catch the disc in the opposing end zone. Players pass the disc without running. If the disc is dropped or intercepted, it's a turnover.</p>

          <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No running with the disc:</strong> You must stop and pivot.</li>
            <li><strong>10-second rule:</strong> You have 10 seconds to throw.</li>
            <li><strong>Turnovers:</strong> Drop, block, or out-of-bounds changes possession.</li>
            <li><strong>Pull:</strong> Each point starts with a long throw to the opponent.</li>
            <li><strong>In-bounds:</strong> First point of contact must land in bounds.</li>

          <h2>Scoring</h2>
          <p>You score a goal if you catch the disc in the endzone that you are
attacking. If you are in the air, your first point of contact must be in the
endzone. If your foot touches the goal line, it is not a goal. After a goal,
play stops and teams swap which end zone they are defending. The
first team to 15 goals wins, with a time cap of 100 minutes, but this can
change depending on the level of play</p>

          <h2>Spirit of the Game</h2>
          <p>Ultimate relies upon a Spirit of the Game that places the responsibility
for fair play on every player. There are no referees; the players are
solely responsible for following and enforcing the rules, even at World
Championships. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but should
never sacrifice the mutual respect between players, adherence to the
agreed-upon rules of the game, player safety or the basic joy of play.</p>

          <h2>Substitution</h2>
          <p>After each point, you may substitute as many players as you want.
During a point a player may only be substituted due to an injury. After
an injury, play stops and the other team may also substitute a player, if
they wish.</p>
